jumpclub description could be better

remove "A look inside React" from all react internal article descriptions

projects page: need to sort projects better somehow

for feature type, Video Game is capitalized, but website and others are not

arduboy project: better description needed. bit about 26kb is awkward.

breakouts: "A collection" -> "A community created collection"

particle systems description: link to the article

extracting: "to build gifs" -> "to build animated gifs"



dates are formatted as en-us. probably due to rendering with node versus the browser

about: "such as React" -> "such as React, Svelte and Web Assembly
