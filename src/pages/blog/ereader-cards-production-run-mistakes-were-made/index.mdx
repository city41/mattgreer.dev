A while back I got the cards for [Series One](https://retrodotcards.com/series-one) back from the printer.

I then proceeded to package them all up to get ready to sell them.

But I won't be selling any of these cards, despite taking _days_ to package them all up. These cards have several problems in them, and so I decided to have them reprinted.

## Problems

### Die Cutting Tabs

One problem I knew about right away &mdash; but at first shrugged off &mdash; was the artifact tabs left on the cards from the die cutter.

<figure>
	<img src={require('./closeUpOfCardWithTabsPointedOut.jpg').default.src} />
	<figcaption>

	</figcaption>
</figure>

The red lines are pointing out the tabs. And yeah, they are very tiny. Unless you know they are there, you might even miss them.

A die cutting machine was used to cut the cards out. But the machine can't fully cut the card out of the sheet, otherwise they'd all fall to the floor and create a huge mess. So the machine always leaves behind tabs that keep the cards connected. Then later a person can punch the cards off of the sheet in a controlled and non-chaotic way. It's true when just looking at one card they aren't very noticable. But if you stack a bunch of cards together, they are very obvious. And once you know about them, you can't ignore them.

<figure>
	<img src={require('./stackOfCardsWithTabs.jpg').default.src} />

</figure>

I wasn't happy with these tabs from day one, but I originally planned to just roll with them. These tabs gnawed at me, because otherwise the cards came out great!

### Shrinkwrapping woes

The printer bundled the cards into sets of 100 and shrinkwrapped them. This ended up messing up the ink on the cards at the top and bottom of each bundle. The heat gun used for the shrinkwrapping heated the ink back up on these outer cards, then the pressure from the shrinkwrap caused the top two to four, and bottom two to four cards in each bundle to stick together.

Honestly this wasn't that big of a deal, once I fully realized the issue. I just removed the messed up cards and set them aside. I'd either sell those at a discount, or give them away, or something. After all the cards were still fully functional.

But I made a really bad mistake here. If a card that was stuck together looked good on the front, it almost always meant the ink on the back of the card was messed up instead. I didn't realize this until I had already packaged up a _lot_ of cards, so that box of booster packs up above had "landmines" littered throughout it. Just by bad luck, someone was going to get sent messed up cards, and there was no way to know which ones were bad!

### Color reproduction

Color comes in two "systems", additive and subtractive. Computer monitors use an additive system, the more light there is, the closer the color comes to white. Pigments and inks are subtractive, the _less_ pigment there is, the closer the color is to white (assuming you're printing on white paper).

Additive color is handled with RGB lights (red, green, and blue), and subtractive is handled with CMYK pigments (cyan, magenta, yellow and black). The problem is, there are differences between the two. In short, what you see on your monitor isn't necessarily what you will get once it is printed out on paper. Professional designers deal with this by color calibrating their monitors to help ensure what they see on their screen matches more closely to what gets printed. I have no way to do that, the hardware needed is very pricey. I entirely live and work in an RGB world. What I get from the printer can be a surprise.

The vast majority of the time, this isn't a problem. The differences are often nothing at all or very minor. But it turns out I gambled and lost with the backs of the cards. What were bright and vibrant reds and purples on my monitor came out dull and "dirty" looking on paper.

	<img src={require('./backComparison.jpg').default.src} />
	<figcaption>Two different back designs for the cards.</figcaption>
</figure>

On the left is the back design that was used for the first print run. It's hard to see in a photo, but the colors are just not very good. Also the purple ink going right up to the edge left behind a small white "halo" that comes from the edge of the card.

<wisdom>
	The halo effect is truly the very edge of the card. The card design had proper
	bleed setup so that once cut out, the purple went up to the very edge of the
	face of the card. It's just the thin side walls of the card that cause the
	undesirable "halo".
</wisdom>

The one on the right was the back I used for the reprint. These colors were more pigment friendly and the new card backs look worlds better!

### Miscuts

A very small number of cards in the run got cut incorrectly. Actually the Solitaire card above was one of those cards.

<figure>
	<img src={require('./closeUpOfCardWithTabsPointedOut.jpg').default.src} />
	<figcaption>A miscut card with the data strip getting cut off.</figcaption>
</figure>

See how the data strip is cut off on the left side? Due to the way E-Reader cards work, this card still scans and plays just fine. Less than 0.5% of the cards were miscut like this, so really it wasn't a big deal. That's just the reality of mass production.

### And ... a really bad bug

And finally, the mistake that made the reprint a must, one of the games had a terrible bug. These cards aren't like modern games, you can't send your customers "patch cards" :) I tested the living heck out of these games, and other people helped as well. In the end I've played these games so much it's honestly ridiculous. But even still, a dumb mistake allowed a bad bug to sneak through.

I needed to at least reprint the game that had the bug. But with all the other issues, I decided to bite the bullet and do a full reprint of all of the games. This also allowed me to fix some minor cosmetic bugs in a few of the games as well. Bugs that I doubt anyone but me would notice, but if I'm reprinting anyway, I might as well fix them.

## A much better second run

This was a fairly painful lesson to learn. But ah well, that's life sometimes. I knew I had to learn some of these lessons the hard way as this is both a physical medium where mistakes are often costly, and something I am brand new to. So all in all I'm not too bothered by all of this. Here are the lessons/changes I've applied to the second run.

### No more shrinkwrapping

The printer delivered the second run to me in boxes, with slips of paper separating out the cards. So this time no cards were damaged by heat and every single card is in excellent condition.

It also turned out bundling the cards in the shrink wrap led to more packaging work. I had to manually get one of each card into a pile before I could package it. This time around, the cards were organized in the box such that they already form booster pack bundles within the box. So now I just grab the cards, and quickly divide them into booster packs, so much easier!

### No more die cutting

This time around, the die cutting machine was not used at all. Instead the printer cut the cards out using straight cuts. No more tabs!

But wait, the edges are now just square? No, I am cutting the corners out myself using this device.

<<< image of corner cutter >>>

This device can cut the corners of many cards at once. But if you're not careful, the cuts can be inaccurate due to the cards shifting around as the cut is happening. This device takes some practice and patience. But as long as you have that, it works great.

Printers offer this service and can cut the corners for you. They would use a device very similar to this, but more likely they have an electronic version. But in my experience, printers always throw out the caveat that the cuts might be inaccurate here and there. That is because to get good cuts with these machines, you really need to take your time. But a printer (understandably) doesn't want to do that. They want to get the cards cut rapidly so they can move onto the next job.

### A cheat code in one game

As for that nasty bug. I fixed it, but I also included a cheat code in that game that allows me to thoroughly test the situations where the bug came up, quickly and easily. Once I was done with my code changes, I just left the cheat code in the game. This is the true origin of cheat codes back in the 80s, they were really there to help the development team. They just left them in because why not? They ended up becoming a marketing gimmick and something players even expected in their games. It's very reassuring to grab a production card, scan it in, enter the cheat code, and see for sure the bug is gone. And just to be clear, I also thoroughly tested the bug is gone without using the cheat code, it just takes much longer to do that.

## Why am I telling you all this?

I'm new to physical product production. Manufacturing, packaging, fulfillment, I've never done any of these things before. I have no problem sharing my mistakes with others in hopes others can also learn from them. I wish more people talked about their mistakes. I really appreciate it when other developers give retrospectives on issues that came up for them. I want to help contribute to that.

## Conclusion

Now with these new cards, I can feel a lot better about selling them. I know the quality is up to my standards, and I don't have to secretly hope people don't notice the small issues that crept in.

If you are interested in getting a pack yourself, they will be on sale July 27th at https://retrodotcards.com.
