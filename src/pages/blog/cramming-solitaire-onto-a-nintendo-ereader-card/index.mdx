I recently finished making Solitaire for the Nintendo E-Reader. I managed to fit it onto a single card, and it's a pretty full featured version of the game. I'm really happy with how it turned out. I figured I'd talk a bit about how I made it in what turned out to be a long blog post :)

## What is the E-Reader?

The E-Reader was a peripheral that Nintendo released for the Game Boy Advance in 2002. By scanning cards that have a dot code strip on them, you can load games and other things with it.

I've always really liked this device and was sad it didn't do very well in America. So I thought maybe I'd take a stab at it myself and see what I can make for it.

## Tools and docs, starting way back in the past...

I remembered there were some old tools and websites about making E-Reader cards from back around when it first came out &mdash; twenty years ago! I managed to find <a href="https://www.schuerewegen.tk/">Tim Schuerewegen's</a> original site in the Wayback Machine. It had some examples, source code and tools. I also refound <a href="https://caitsith2.com/ereader/">CaitSith2's E-Reader site</a>, which thankfully is still up. It also has some tools and information.

<wisdom>
	These tools are the backbone of E-Reader dev. Thanks to Tim and CaitSith2 for
	making them! They were originally made for Windows, but they were also made{' '}
	<a href="https://github.com/breadbored/nedclib">multi-platform here</a>.
</wisdom>

These initial findings were a great start and got me headed down learning how E-Reader applications are programmed. Gbatek also has [a section on the E-Reader](https://problemkaputt.de/gbatek.htm#gbacartereader) which also contains lots of useful information.

More recently I found [AkBKukU's e-reader-dev repo](https://github.com/AkBKukU/e-reader-dev) which has also been very helpful.

## Pick your poison: GBA, NES or ... z80?

E-Reader cards can come in four broad formats

### Game Boy Advance applications

These are GBA programs written much like if you were making a normal GBA game. The E-Reader simply loads them in then lets them execute on their own for the most part.

### NES games

The E-Reader contains a simple NES emulator, so it is possible to directly put simple NES games onto E-Reader cards. The keyword here is "simple", it cannot do more advanced NES tricks. Also the E-Reader has a limit on how many card swipes one application can have. The NES games Nintendo released require 10 card swipes to load! So in the end it is only possible to run early/small NES games. Nintendo used this to release games like Excitebike and Donkey Kong for the E-Reader

<figure>
	<img
		src={require('./excitebike.jpg').default.src}
		alt="Excitebike in E-Reader card format"
	/>
	<figcaption>Excitebike in E-Reader card format</figcaption>
</figure>

### Raw binaries

Raw E-Reader cards just contain binary information of some kind. Specific games made use of these to add levels, characters, etc. Kind of like a primitive form of DLC. It is up to the specific game to interpret the data as it sees fit.

Super Mario Advance 4 released cards like this, adding additional levels into the game

<figure>
	<img
		src={require('./sma4LevelCards.jpg').default.src}
		alt="Super Mario Advance 4 E-Reader level cards"
	/>
	<figcaption>Super Mario Advance 4 E-Reader level cards</figcaption>
</figure>

### z80 Applications

And finally the E-Reader also contains a simple z80 emulator. The z80 is an 8-bit processor that first came out in 1976! It was very successful and found in many different computers. It's a pretty simple processor, and I'm guessing making the emulator for it wasn't too difficult for Nintendo and so they adopted this route.

<figure>
	<img
		src={require('./manhole.jpg').default.src}
		alt="Manhole: a simple E-Reader game written for the z80"
	/>
	<figcaption>Manhole: a simple E-Reader game written for the z80</figcaption>
</figure>

That means E-Reader apps can be written in z80 assembly. The primary advantage here is z80 apps tend to be quite small. In my experimenting, I found an E-Reader z80 app to be about 30-50% smaller than an equivalent E-Reader GBA app. Nintendo almost entirely went this route with their own cards, I'm guessing to keep the number of swipes needed for an application to a minimum.

## z80 E-Reader apps

I made Solitaire as a z80 application and have become pretty entrenched in this approach. I really like how much smaller the resulting binaries are. But make no doubt about it, z80 assembly is pretty rough. Especially considering you can write a GBA game in C.

### The ERAPI API

For z80 games, Nintendo embedded a simple but effective [API](https://problemkaputt.de/gbatek.htm#gbacartereaderapifunctions) into the E-Reader that they can take advantage of. Things like creating sprites, playing music, even multiplying and dividing, can all be done through this API.

<wisdom>
	GBA E-Reader games also make use of this API, but in a different way. There is
	a lot of overlap and similaries, but the two approaches don't exactly map 1:1
	to each other.
</wisdom>

As a simple example, here is how to create a sprite using the API

```asm
    ; ERAPI_SpriteCreate()
    ; e  = pal#
    ; hl = sprite data
    ld  e, #2
    ld  hl, #my_sprite_data_struct
    rst 0
    .db ERAPI_SpriteCreate
    ld  (my_sprite_handle), hl
```

If you're not familiar with z80 assembly this probably looks bizarre. It is basically the equivalent of

```c
int my_sprite_handle = SpriteCreate(2, my_sprite_data_struct);
```

The `ld` calls are "load", and here we are loading the `e` register with which palette index we want the sprite to use. The `hl` register is loaded with a pointer to the information about the sprite (its tiles, colors, frames of animation, etc). The `rst 0` and `.db ERAPI_SpriteCreate` lines are where we actually make the API call. Without getting too deep on how the z80 works, this is basically a function call. When it is done, it will leave the handle to the sprite in the hl register, so we `ld (my_sprite_handle), hl` to copy that value off into memory for safe keeping. That handle is later used whenever we want to interact with the sprite, such as changing its position.

### A crippled z80

The E-Reader contains a z80 emulator, and that emulator is not 100% accurate. It is known to not support certain opcodes, and I also found that some opcodes just don't seem to work.

The z80 is already a very limited processor, and this makes it even moreso. Sometimes E-Reader z80 development is downright painful. But them's the breaks...

### A challenge...

My only other exposure to assembly thus far is when I made some [Neo Geo ROM hacks](https://neorh.mattgreer.dev/). The Neo Geo has a Motorola 68000 processor, which is more advanced and easier to work with than the z80.

But I didn't even have a full z80, the cpu's limitations compounded with the emulator's limitations at times made coding quite challenging. I often felt like this when trying to do something

<figure>
	<img
		src={require('./austinPowers.jpg').default.src}
		alt="Austin Powers trying to turn around in a tunnel"
		style={{ imageRendering: 'pixelated' }}
	/>
</figure>

Simple things that I usually take for granted like copying one array to another is just so much harder to do in E-Reader z80 assembly. Thankfully I'm starting to get the hang of it.

### Debugging

Another huge challenge was debugging the game. There's no way to log anything, running the game on a Game Boy Advance is a total black box. GBA emulators like [mGBA](https://mgba.io/) have good debugging features. But this is a z80 emulator written for the GBA's ARM processor. I figured stepping through ARM instructions trying to figure out how the emulator worked would be a herculean task, so much so I never even tried. Thankfully I don't think I'll ever need to, more on that below.

As a first stab at this, I took [z80js](https://github.com/5inf/z80js), z80 emulator core, and built a small application that would run my binary and log out what the cpu was doing. The output looked like this

```
...
0B52: call _deck_gfx_render_column            | a:  17, b:  00, c:  03, d:  08, e:  5c, h:  00, l:  17, bc: 0003, de: 085c, hl: 0017, ix: 0000, iy: 0000
0B5B: ld   b,#0x13                            | a:  17, b:  00, c:  03, d:  08, e:  5c, h:  00, l:  17, bc: 0003, de: 085c, hl: 0017, ix: 0000, iy: 0000
0B5D: ld   c,#0x00                            | a:  17, b:  13, c:  03, d:  08, e:  5c, h:  00, l:  17, bc: 1303, de: 085c, hl: 0017, ix: 0000, iy: 0000
0B5F: ld   hl,(_deck_gfx_cur_column_addr)     | a:  17, b:  13, c:  00, d:  08, e:  5c, h:  00, l:  17, bc: 1300, de: 085c, hl: 0017, ix: 0000, iy: 0000
0B62: ld   d,#0x00                            | a:  17, b:  13, c:  00, d:  08, e:  5c, h:  08, l:  5c, bc: 1300, de: 085c, hl: 085c, ix: 0000, iy: 0000
0B64: ld   e,c                                | a:  17, b:  13, c:  00, d:  00, e:  5c, h:  08, l:  5c, bc: 1300, de: 005c, hl: 085c, ix: 0000, iy: 0000
0B65: add  hl,de                              | a:  17, b:  13, c:  00, d:  00, e:  00, h:  08, l:  5c, bc: 1300, de: 0000, hl: 085c, ix: 0000, iy: 0000
...
```

That looks like pure gibberish here in the blog because the lines are very long. Each line contains the opcod the cpu executed, and the state of all its registers at that time.

```
0B5B: ld b,#0x13 | a:17, b:00, c:03, d:08, e:5c, h:00, l:17,
	bc:0003, de:085c,hl: 0017, ix:0000, iy:0000
```

here is a single line, cleaned up a little bit. Looking at this now, I'm not sure why I bothered to dump `ix` and `iy`, as they'd always be zero...

This ... worked. I mean it got the job done and I was able to fix bugs by examining this output. But it wasn't very fun. A huge downside to this approach is it wasn't interactive. It just blindly ran the game without allowing any button presses or anything like that. Because of this, I often had to get very creative to get this emulator to execute the code I was having troubles with.

### A proper debugger

I used this tracing approach to write most of the game. But towards the end there were two mysterious bugs I just could not figure out. I knew I needed a better solution.

I stumbled across the [DeZog](https://github.com/maziac/DeZog) project, which is a general purpose z80 debugging extension for VS Code. This looked really promising, but then I found [ZX81-Debugger](https://github.com/andrivet/ZX81-Debugger). Sebastien Andrivet took DeZog as a basis and made a VS Code extension specifically for writing and debugging [ZX81](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX81) applications.

I really liked ZX81-Debugger right away, what a great tool. Just install it and _boom_ you've got a full fledged ZX81 development environment. I forked its code and started adapting it to work with E-Reader apps. Since both platforms have the z80 processor in common, this turned out to not be as difficult as I thought it would be.

After a couple days of hacking, I surprisingly had an E-Reader debugger running in VS Code! In the end, I was positively floored how quickly I got this working. I am truly standing on the shoulders of giants...so thank you to everyone who made all of this possible.

<figure>
	<img
		src={require('./ereaderDebugger.png').default.src}
		alt="The E-Reader debugger running in VS Code"
		style={{ imageRendering: 'pixelated' }}
	/>
	<figcaption>The E-Reader debugger running in VS Code</figcaption>
</figure>

[here is that image](/ereaderDebugger.png) full size.

To get this working I removed a few ZX81 things and then wrote a simple ERAPI emulator. As ERAPI calls come in, the debugger sends them over to my little emulator, which then translates them into a visual GBA screen.

<figure>
	<img
		src={require('./erapiScreen.png').default.src}
		alt="A close up of the ERAPI emulator screen output"
		style={{ imageRendering: 'pixelated' }}
	/>
	<figcaption>A close up of the ERAPI emulator screen output</figcaption>
</figure>

The background is green because I've not added the background related API functions to the emulator yet. And below the screen I am dumping out the current state of all the sprites that were created through ERAPI.

You can even take a commercial E-Reader game and run it in the debugger. It will disassemble the binary and provide a very nice debugging experience. This will be helpful to further figure out more about how E-Reader cards and ERAPI works.

<figure>
	<img
		src={require('./kirbyInDebugger.png').default.src}
		alt="An official Nintendo E-Reader card, running in the debugger"
		style={{ imageRendering: 'pixelated' }}
	/>
	<figcaption>
		An official Nintendo E-Reader card, running in the debugger
	</figcaption>
</figure>

The colors in that Kirby card are all weird because my ERAPI emulator is super raw and does many things incorrectly. It's drawing the image using the wrong palettes. A lot more work needs to be done.

This is just amazing! I can honestly say I never thought I'd get a developer experience this powerful on a forgotten, 20 year old, Nintendo peripheral. We really live in exciting times sometimes.

<wisdom>
	Ultimately I will open source the E-Reader-Debugger. But as it stands, it's
	not even alpha quality. It's extremely early. After I've worked out more
	kinks, I will throw it up on GitHub.
</wisdom>

## Challenges with the ERAPI API

Overall ERAPI is very useful, and has lots of great stuff to make development easier. But I did find some of the stuff didn't work so great. Either because it wasn't implemented so well, or maybe I just don't yet understand how to use it properly.

I really struggled with this when rendering the playfield for Solitaire. Being an old game system, the GBA has limitations with sprites. It might have 128 you can use, but you can't put too many on the screen at once or else things like this can happen

<iframe
	width={560}
	height={315}
	style={{ margin: '3em 0' }}
	src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WE4CgMpjD88"
	frameBorder={0}
	allowFullScreen
></iframe>

This video shows Solitaire when I first started working on it. I wanted to see if I could use sprit/s to draw all the cards. I concluced I couldn't and instead would need to draw the cards into a background. Using backgrounds for graphics like this is a very common tactic on older game systems. But no worries, ERAPI has the function `SpriteDrawOnBackground`, and it seems to be meant exactly for this use case.

Using this function, I was able to easily draw my sprites into the background and avoid all graphical glitching ... the first time the playfield was drawn. As it was drawn repeatedly, it seemed like the tiles in video RAM were getting corrupted

<iframe
	width={560}
	height={315}
	style={{ margin: '3em 0' }}
	src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jz8RZF68B58"
	frameBorder={0}
	allowFullScreen
></iframe>

In this video I was reshuffling and redealing the deck repeatedly. And each time I dealt it out again, graphical glitches would appear.

I tried and tried, but I just could not get this to work. I'm not completely sure I wasn't doing something wrong. But ERAPI and the way z80 apps work with the emulator seems pretty straightforward. So I _think_ this function was not meant for rapid use like this.

ERAPI has another function, `LoadCustomBackground`, and it was this one that was a winner for my game. It's a lower level and harder to use function than `SpriteDrawOnBackground`, but it has never caused graphical glitches on me even once.

<iframe
	width={560}
	height={315}
	style={{ margin: '3em 0' }}
	src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4-uaNX9LGN4"
	frameBorder={0}
	allowFullScreen
></iframe>

With this function, it is up to me to figure out which tiles go where to form a background. Then once I've figured it all out, I just send it to the GBA in one function call and it appears on the screen.

## z80 E-Reader apps are kinda script-like

I have found the way E-Reader z80 apps work to be pretty interesting. The emulator uses the `halt` opcode to mean "draw a frame to the screen". You can load the `a` register with how many frames it should draw, accomplishing a very simple way to add waits to your game.

<iframe
	width={560}
	height={315}
	style={{ margin: '3em 0' }}
	src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k5GrjMe4Ef0"
	frameBorder={0}
	allowFullScreen
></iframe>

Take this little intro animation. I built it like this

```typescript
	logoHandle = createSprite(logo);
	setSpritePosition(logoHandle, 120, 20);

	footerHandle = createSprite(footer);
	setSpritePosition(footerHandle, 120, 60)

	playSystemSound(DRUM_ROLL);

	for (let i = 0; i < NUM_CARDS_TO_DEAL) {
		dealOneCard(i);
		// render one frame to show the newly dealt card
		halt(1);
	}

	playSystemSound(CYMBOL);

	// wait for 30 frames
	halt(30)

	// tear down the logos
	freeSprite(logoHandle);
	freeSprite(footerHandle);

	// let the regular gameplay loop take over from here
```

In the actual game this was done in assembly, I turned it into psuedo-code here to make it easier to read.

What I find interesting is I just whipped up a typical game engine loop on the spot, just to deal out the cards. I didn't need to hook all this into a main game loop like you do with most game development. The entire rest of the game doesn't know or even care that this happens. I found this approach kind of interesting.

<wisdom>
	And yes, there's nothing to stop you from doing this in other game development
	environments. But it's so simple and straightforward here that it almost seems
	like Nintendo intended it to work like this
</wisdom>

## E-Reader assets

You might have noticed my game has music, sound effects, and a Mars-like rocky background. The E-Reader itself has many assets a game can use. This helps keep the E-Reader app small. You can do custom graphics (such as the deck of cards in my game) and sounds, but they tend to be quite large and take up precious space.

<figure>
	<img
		src={require('./ereaderSystemBackgrounds.png').default.src}
		alt="Some of the backgrounds found on the E-Reader"
		style={{ imageRendering: 'pixelated' }}
	/>
	<figcaption>Some of the backgrounds found on the E-Reader</figcaption>
</figure>

Altogether there are over 100 backgrounds, 800 sounds (both sound effects and music) and over 200 Pokémon sprites stored in the E-Reader's 8MB ROM. If you're an E-Reader fan, you might have noticed Nintendo's mini games tend to reuse the same sound effects, music and often the same backgrounds. This is why.

Using them is usually just a simple API call. For example here is how I play the drum roll sound effect

```asm
    ld hl, 755
    rst 8
    .db ERAPI_PlaySystemSound
```

Crazy ass assembly conventions aside, this is pretty much just `PlaySystemSound(755)`.

## How big can E-Reader apps be?

A single E-Reader dotstrip can store 2,192 bytes of data, which is nearly 3kb. But there is some overhead with the headers, and error correction, making the actual amount of data I've been able to store on a single strip closer to 2kb. The data on the dotstrip is compressed though, which helps a lot.

<figure>
	<img
		src={
			require('../printing-ereader-cards/helloWorld.dotcode.bmp.png').default
				.src
		}
		alt="An example dotcode strip"
	/>
	<figcaption>An example dotcode strip</figcaption>
</figure>

The compression makes the total storage size kind of fuzzy. It really depends on how well your data compresses. For example, here are the tiles for my cards

<figure>
	<img
		src={require('./deck_strips.png').default.src}
		alt="The card graphic tiles for Solitaire"
		style={{ imageRendering: 'pixelated' }}
	/>
	<figcaption>The card graphic tiles for Solitaire</figcaption>
</figure>

I could have saved space by not repeating the same tile over and over again. But this data compressed _very_ well. So well, I just went with it. Deduping these tiles would have made the drawing routines much more complicated, maybe so much so the space that the routine's code would have taken up might have even killed any space savings.

In the end I didn't need to do too much space optimization to keep Solitaire down to two dotstrips (which can be printed on a single card). I did use up all the space that those two strips alloted me, so any more features would have likely required the game be expanded to three dotstrips, something I really wanted to avoid.

Honestly I'm a bit surprised how many strips are needed for some of Nintendo's cards. Based on the game contained inside and my experience writing Solitaire, it seems like some of their games could have been done in fewer dotstrips. But that's just a total guess, I don't really know.

### The E-Reader and GBA limitations on space

The E-Reader itself allows a maximum of 12 strips to be scanned for a single application. Although I've yet to find any application that requires that many. The NES games need 10

<figure>
	<img
		src={require('./tenStripsNeeded.png').default.src}
		alt="The E-Reader waiting for 9 more strips to load Excitebike"
		style={{ imageRendering: 'pixelated' }}
	/>
	<figcaption>
		The E-Reader waiting for 9 more strips to load Excitebike
	</figcaption>
</figure>

As for the Game Boy Advance itself, it has 256kb of RAM which is more than enough to store any E-Reader application. The E-Reader will decompress the data into RAM, then execute it. I suppose technically your data could exceed 256kb when decompressed, but realistically I just can't see that happening.

## More E-Reader cards to come

My goal is to make many more E-Reader apps. I am hoping to build 10 apps and have the cards for them professionally manufactured. Hopefully packaged up in a booster pack, which would be so cool. Why? Why not. I think the E-Reader is really cool and this is a lot of fun.

If new E-Reader cards interests you, check out https://retrodotcards.com. If you want to try Solitaire out for yourself, you can order a card there. They are free.
