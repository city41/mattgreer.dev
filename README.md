# MattGreer.dev

This is my personal portfolio/blog site, found at https://mattgreer.dev

## Status

Deployed and functional. Still needs some fixes and tweaks. Also really not happy with MDX and need to do something else (ugh).

## To Deploy

Getting node-canvas to work in Vercel is a beast. So far I've not been successful. So in the interim, before deploying, need to run `node scripts/generateRssFeed.js` and `node scripts/generateTwitterImages.js`, this can also be done via `yarn local-build`
